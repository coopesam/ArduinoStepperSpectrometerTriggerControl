 Things to do: 1) Make stepper acceleration ramp (most likely through a function of delay() length decreases).
 2) add in the limit switch abort to the moveMotor() command
 3) Add in the z-direction motor

int xMotor = 6;         //This pin is the pulse output for the X-direction motor.  Again, we may need two of these pins.
int limitSwitch = 12;   //We will be using this pin for the limit switch motor stop function.
int trigger = 13;       //This pin will be used to trigger the spectrometer.
int interrupt = A0;      //The interrupt pin used for the limit switches on the stage so that nothing can break.  Used to abort moveMotor() function.

int xSteps = 0;          //This is the number of steps we'll move the x motor between each measurement.  Default to zero steps for safety.
int zSteps = 0;          //This is the number of steps we'll move the z motor between each measurement.  Default to zero steps for safety.
int directVar = 0;      //This variable is for the direction of movement. 1 = right (into the beam / away from the motor);
